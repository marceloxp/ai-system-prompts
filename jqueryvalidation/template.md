# jQuery Validation Plugin

> This jQuery plugin makes simple clientside form validation easy, whilst still offering plenty of customization options. It makes a good choice if you’re building something new from scratch, but also when you’re trying to integrate something into an existing application with lots of existing markup. The plugin comes bundled with a useful set of validation methods, including URL and email validation, while providing an API to write your own methods. All bundled methods come with default error messages in english and translations into 37 other languages.

## Usage example

```html
@@include('index.html')
```

```js
@@include('code.js')
```

## Objectives

- The CValidator class presented above only serves as a reference. 
- The user will ask you for a version of this class adapted to the form he will show you.
- Your response should only be with the adapted class javascript.
